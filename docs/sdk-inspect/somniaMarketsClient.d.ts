 * An SDK client — the single handle for all protocol I/O.

 * SomniaMarkets(config)` → `exchange.client`). Each exchange's engine is fully
 * isolated: its own config, live store, and (lazily opened) chain WebSocket,
 * so several can coexist in one process without sharing state.
 *
 * The read surface has three tiers — pick by freshness need:
 * 1. **Live store** (`getLive*`, synchronous): zero round-trips, updates the
 *    moment an event lands on-chain. Requires a watch ({@link watchMarket} /
 *    {@link watchMarkets}) covering the market you read.
 * 2. **Chain** (`getBinaryOrderBook`, `getMarketOnchain`, …): one `eth_call`
 *    round-trip, current to head. Works without any watch.
 * 3. **Indexer** (`listMarkets`, `getPortfolio`, …): history and aggregates;
 *    lags the chain slightly. Works without any watch or the socket.

     *
     *  Use to reach a contract or RPC method the SDK does not model: your own

     *
     *  Building your own client instead would open a second WebSocket; this one
     *  shares the SDK's.
     *
     *  **Gotchas**
     *
     *  Reads through this client do NOT get the SDK's decoded protocol errors — a
     *  revert arrives as viem's error, not a {@link ContractRevertError} with an
     *  `errorName`. That is the point of the accessor, but it means you should
     *  prefer the SDK's own methods for protocol contracts, where the decoding is
     *  the value. The two clients are deliberately different: everything reachable
     *  from this interface uses the decoded one.
     *
     *  Calling this opens the WebSocket if it is not already open, and throws
     *  {@link NotConfiguredError} on a client built without `wsRpcUrl`.
