     *  **When to use**
     *
     *  Reach for this when the signing and the sending are not the same moment: to
     *  pre-sign an ERC-4337 UserOp while the user is still filling in the form, to
     *  batch the order into a multicall, to hand it to a relayer, or to simulate it.
     *  For ordinary "place this order now", use {@link Trader.placeOrder} — it is
     *  one call and it handles the approval for you.
     *
     *  **Gotchas**
     *
     *  The approval is RETURNED, not sent. `placeOrder` approves as a side effect;
     *  this cannot, because sending is exactly what it must not do. Send `approval`
     *  first when it is present, or the order reverts on-chain.
     *
     *  Still `async`: a binary placement reads the pool's market expiry when the
     *  caller does not pass `expireTimestampNs`, and resolves the pool's escrow
     *  tokens to work out which approval is needed. Pass `expireTimestampNs`,
     *  `outcomeToken`, `yesId`, `noId`, and `collateral` to keep it off the network.
     *
     *  No gas estimate and no nonce ride along — those belong to the signer, and
     *  pinning them here would stale the moment the call is cached.
     *
     * @example
     * Pre-sign off the form, send on the click.
     * ```ts
     * const { order, approval } = await trader.buildPlaceOrder({
     *   pool, side: "BUY_YES", price: 620_000n, quantity: 10_000_000n,
     * });
     * if (approval) await walletClient.sendTransaction({ ...approval, account });
